# Information Disclosure
Information disclosure, also known as information leakage, is when a website unintentionally reveals sensitive information to its users.

## Examples of Information Disclosure
  - Revealing the names of hidden directories, their structure, and their contents via a robots.txt file or directory listing
  - Providing access to source code files via temporary backups
  - Explicitly mentioning database table or column names in error messages
  - Unnecessarily exposing highly sensitive information, such as credit card details
  - Hard-coding API keys, IP addresses, database credentials, and so on in the source code
  - Hinting at the existence or absence of resources, usernames, and so on via subtle differences in application behavior
